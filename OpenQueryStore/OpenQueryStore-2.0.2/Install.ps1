<#
.SYNOPSIS
Install OpenQueryStore on specified instance/database.

.DESCRIPTION
Verify if OQS is not already installed on destination database and if not will run the scripts to install it.

.PARAMETER SqlInstance
The SQL Server that you're connecting to.

.PARAMETER Database
Specifies the Database where OQS objects will be created

.PARAMETER OQSMode
Specifies the mode OQS should operate in. Classic (monitoring a single database) or Centralized (a separate OQS database to monitor multiple databases)

.PARAMETER SchedulerType
Specifies which type of scheduling of data collection should be used. Either "Service Broker" (Default) or "SQL Agent"

.PARAMETER CertificateBackupPath
Specifies the path where certificate backup will be temporarily saved. By default "C:\temp" (the file is deleted immediately after installation)

.EXAMPLE
.\Install.ps1 -SqlInstance SQL2012 -Database ScooterStore -OQSMode "Classic" -SchedulerType "Service Broker" -CertificateBackupPath "C:\temp"

Will install the Classic version on instance SQL2012 database named ScooterStore and use Service Broker for scheduling, storing the certificate in c:\temp.

.EXAMPLE
.\Install.ps1 -SqlInstance "SQL2012" -Database "db3" -OQSMode "Centralized" -SchedulerType "SQL Agent"

Will install the centralized version on instance SQL2012 database named db3 and use the SQL Agent for scheduling.
