After the last few years of finding some good ideas and tweaking my script I wanted to let everyone use it. If you want.

Here are some directions on how to use it.

1) Create a text file and name it Backup_All_Databases.sql (or what ever you want).

2) Paste the below script in it:

3) Open scheduler and create a new task that calls the below command line:

Code:
sqlcmd -S . -i "C:\Backups\BackupSettings\Backup_All_Databases.sql"

Note: I also made a batch file that had the same command line but added a pause so I can test it before the scheduler runs it.
EXAMPLE:

Code:
sqlcmd -S . -i "C:\Backups\BackupSettings\Backup_All_Databases.sql"
pause

4) Just run it every night in a scheduler and you are done.


Clean up Old Backup Files.

If you are running Windows Server 2003 you can also run a command utility to delete any files older then x number of days. This helps keep it cleaned up. Just paste this in a batch file and schedule the batch file.


Code:
echo on

rem First Delete old SQL Backup Files

FORFILES /p C:\Backuped_SQL_DB /s /m *.* /d -3 /c "CMD /C del /Q @FILE"

rem pauseThis will also work on SQL Express
