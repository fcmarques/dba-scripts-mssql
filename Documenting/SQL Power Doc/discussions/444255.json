You get a cleaner interface then.\r<br />\n<br />\nBut: My compliments!!!!!<br />\n",

Thanks for bringing it to my attention.\r<br />\n<br />\nAs for single vs. multiple modules, I took the multiple module route intentionally so that they could be used &amp; extended in creative ways without having to load every single module every time. I've got plans to write some blog posts in the future about doing more lightweight things with each module so stay tuned...\r<br />\n<br />\n-Kendal<br />\n",
