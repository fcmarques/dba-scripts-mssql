I am getting a false positive performance suggestion that isn't relevant as mount points are being used: \r<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The Default Data Path is configured for a drive (Z:) that currently holds database files of another type. This may result in multiple file types on the same drive when new databases are created which can negatively impact performance.&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nMaking SQL Power Doc mount point aware would rock!\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nCan't say thank you enough,\r<br />\n<br />\nChuck<br />\n",
