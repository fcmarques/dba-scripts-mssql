During the discovery phase SQL Power Doc will determine what port is in use for each instance and use that when making its connection...so the short answer is that disabling the SQL Browser service should not impact SQL Power Doc's ability to connect to an instance running on some other port besides 1433.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for checking out SQL Power Doc!\r<br />\n<br />\n--Kendal<br />\n",
