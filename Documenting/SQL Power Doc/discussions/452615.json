    "Html": "Hello,\r<br />\nThank you for creating SQL Power Doc, this is amazing.  Coming from a Unix background into a MS Windows environment, I was overwhelmed trying to get an overview of all the servers and SQL Servers on the network.  Thank you for sharing this amazing tool.\r<br />\n<br />\nA comment about the 'readme' files included in the download &quot;SqlServerInventory Readme.txt&quot; and &quot;WindowsInventory Readme.txt&quot; - in the section explaining how to run the Convert...toExcel.ps1 script(s), it does not show the input file (-FromPath) as being the .gz file.   The online doc DOES show this but I happened to be following the readme.  So I mistakenly gunzip'd the file and of course the Convert...toExcel.ps1 failed (but thank you for easy to understand error message).  I re-gzip'd my output and the Convert ran fine.\r<br />\nPlease either update the readme.txt in the download, or remove them as you have provided excellent online documentation.\r<br />\n<br />\nAgain, thanks for this utility program, it's a real blessing.<br />\n",
