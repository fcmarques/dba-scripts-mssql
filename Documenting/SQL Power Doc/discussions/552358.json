At least at the Database level to add a description about the purpose of each database. For example, I would add in extended properties myself or use <a href=\"https://datadictionary.codeplex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Data Dictionary Creator</a> to add properties and then use your tool to do an inventory that would include the properties to better describe databases and objects.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nDarren<br />\n",
