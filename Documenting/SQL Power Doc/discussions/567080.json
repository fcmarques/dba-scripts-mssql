I have already used it successfully on a couple of environments and it has saved me a lot of time.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've just started working for a new client and I am trying to use the tool to document a SQL 2000 clustered instance and I am hitting a road block during the WMI connectivity test.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe log file is reporting;\r<br />\n<br />\nWMI response from XXXXX: False\r<br />\n<br />\nI've tried using the differing logging modes and I haven't really got any clearer of an idea why this is happening. I thought it maybe that the WMI service isn't installed for the SQL 2000 instance but not being a WMI guru I'm not sure how to verify this. \r<br />\n<br />\nAny help you can provide would be greatfully received.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks again\r<br />\n<br />\nSimon<br />\n",
