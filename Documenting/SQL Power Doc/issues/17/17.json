    "Description": "probably a minor issue as these scenarios are going to disappear soon (hopefully), but if you have a database with compatiblity level 6.5 on a SQL Server 2000 instance, the following error is risen:\r\n\r\nWARNING: [servername] Error gathering Database information: Exception calling \"ExecuteWithResults\" with \"1\"\r\nargument(s): \"Execute with results failed for Database 'databasename'. \" (SqlServerDatabaseEngineInformation.psm1 line 8391\r\nchar 42)\r\n\r\nSeems no other database information is recorded after the error ad the Excel reports don't have them.",
