    "Description": "When I was trying to run either the Get-SqlServerInventoryToClixml or the Convert-SqlServerInventoryClixmlToExcel I came across an ExecutionPolicy error in that the Modules needed to be signed.  I went through and signed all the modules, but one... NetShell.psm1.  This script errored when I tried to sign it with the following message:\r\n\r\nUTF-16(Big-Endian) and UTF-32 can't be code signed.  Convert your script to Default ANSI, UTF-16(Little Endian) or UTF-8.\r\n\r\nI'm at a loss on how to do that.  Can you advise?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nBrandon_Forest@calquake.com\r\n",

I've moved on since the original message above, but I still would like to resolve this issue and add this tool to my bag of tricks.\n\nThanks!\n\nBrandon_Forest@calquake.com",
