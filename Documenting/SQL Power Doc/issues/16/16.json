Works fine on the old one but on the new one it has this permissions issue which seems weird because I am using the same SQL Server account user/pwd (not Windows).  Perhaps there is something I need to open up on my end (not the target server)?\n\nAny help would be welcomed!\n\nLog follows:\n2017-09-08 15:44:57.8791 ?
