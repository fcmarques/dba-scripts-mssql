    "Description": "Hello Kendal!\r\n\r\nFirst thanks for great Tool! It's very useful.\r\n\r\nAnd than about issue.\r\nIn my case when I collected inventory from servers and try to export to Excel I have got error:\r\nException calling \"Add\" with \"0\" argument(s): \"Old format or invalid type library. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80028018 (TYPE_E_INVDATAREAD))\".\r\nAfter short search I found MS KB http://support.microsoft.com/kb/320369/en-us.\r\nAs I understand there is problem when PowerShell and Excel run with non-English OS version (may be non-English Office too).\r\n\r\nPlease take into account in the next versions Tool.\r\nI resolved the issue by adding this code in PS Module SqlServerInventory.psm1:\r\n[Threading.Thread]::CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = 'en-US'\r\n",
