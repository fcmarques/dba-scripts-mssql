    "Description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nit seems that the scripts does not consider volumes attached to the System via mountpoints.\r\n\r\nWe attach out LUNs using mountpoints like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nE: -> LUN01\r\nE:\\Data01 -> LUN02\r\nE:\\TLOG01 -> LUN03\r\nE:\\BACKUP -> LUN04\r\n```\r\n\r\nVolume E:\\ will be considered during the checks and can be found in the Excel and XML. The other LUNs attached using mountpoints can not be found in the XML or Excel.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\nAndre",
